# Pardon Me
## a wordpress api-wrapper around Pardot

- The official wordpress pardot plugin (https://github.com/Pardot/pardot-for-wordpress) is great for basic interaction.
- But what if we want to gate content based on the current visitor/prospect/user _before_ they enter any form information?
- What if we want to redirect visitors/prospects/users after a form submit, _not based on client side js code_ but rather any conditions we please?
- Pardot's API is extensive and the possibilites for Wordpress Integration are immense.  Let's see if we can flush some of this out.

- authenticate(email, pass, userkey)
- get_visitor_id(cookies)
- get_campaigns()
- get_competitors()
