# Pardon Me
## a wordpress api-wrapper around Pardot

- The current pardot-wordpress plugin is great for basic interaction.
- But what if we want to gate content based on the current visitor/prospect/user _before_ they enter any form information?
- What if we want to redirect visitors/prospects/users after a form submit, but _not based on client side js code_ but rather php?

- Pardot's API is extensive and the possibilites for Wordpress Integration are immense.  Let's see if we can flush some of this out.
